# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification
This project performs classification on the classic Iris flower dataset using Logistic Regression. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its petal and sepal measurements.

✅ Project Highlights:
📊 Dataset: Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features)

🧠 Model Used: Logistic Regression

⚙️ Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy

🔍 Process:

Data loading and preprocessing

Train-test split and feature scaling

Model training and prediction

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Visualization of confusion matrix and performance metrics

📈 Results:
Achieved ~93% accuracy

Visualized confusion matrix and per-class metrics

Observed strong performance for Setosa; minor confusion between Versicolor and Virginica
